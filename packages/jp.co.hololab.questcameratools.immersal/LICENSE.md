LOGO INSTRUCTIONS

First things first, you've found our logo package! It comes with all the different file types you need and some handy guidelines.

Make sure to include the logo in your AR app so that it’s visible throughout the whole AR experience. This way, everyone will know it’s powered by Immersal technology!

Keep readability in mind when placing the logo. It should be big enough and high-res enough for people to easily spot.

Choose a spot for the logo that works well with your app. It should be visible, but not in the way of the user’s experience.

You can use the logo as a watermark with minimum 30% transparency. This strikes a good balance between visibility and not being too obtrusive.

Follow these guidelines provided in the logo package to make sure you’re using it correctly.

Remember that the logo is required for all users, regardless of their subscription plan unless otherwise agreed with Immersal. Please contact sales@immersal.com.

Do not make any modifications on the logo, only use the package provided by Immersal

Don’t forget to grab the updated version of the logo package from our public sample package every once in a while, just to make sure you’re always using the latest version.
